# Morphological Classification of Galaxies
#### Work in Progress.

#### In this Repo, i am going to be uploading a data science project that i finished last year. This aims to create classifiers for Galaxy Classification, using classical machine learning models like decision trees, and neural networks for the images, unsupervised learning will also be covered, and at last, composite systems of classifiers that mixes tabular data with images will be implemented
#### The data comes from https://www.sdss4.org/surveys/ . The Sloan Digital Sky Survey or SDSS is a major multi-spectral imaging and spectroscopic redshift survey using a dedicated 2.5-m wide-angle optical telescope at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, United States. 

#### In the current State, the repo contains one notebook in which I explore and curte the data, along with data visualization.
#### Next i will be uploading the translated version (all work is in spanish) of unsupervised learning.
