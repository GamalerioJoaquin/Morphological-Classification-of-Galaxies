# Morphological Classification of Galaxies

#### Work in Progress.

Welcome to the Morphological Classification of Galaxies project repository. In this repository, I am sharing a data science project that I completed last year. The primary objective of this project is to develop classifiers for galaxy classification. The methodology involves utilizing classical machine learning models such as decision trees and neural networks for image analysis. Additionally, the project explores unsupervised learning techniques and concludes with the implementation of composite systems that integrate tabular data with images.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The SDSS is a significant multi-spectral imaging and spectroscopic redshift survey conducted using a dedicated 2.5-m wide-angle optical telescope located at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, United States.

## Current State

As of now, the repository contains two notebooks. This notebook serves as a comprehensive exploration of the dataset, encompassing data curation and visualization. Additionally, there is an unsupervised learning analysis focused on the dataset's tabular aspects, excluding the image-related components.

Please note that this project is a work in progress, and updates will be provided as new developments unfold. Your feedback and contributions are highly welcome. Thank you for your interest in the Morphological Classification of Galaxies project!
